# NER-with-BILSTM

Named Entity Recognition is a popular task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) where an algorithm is used to identify labels at a word level, in a sentence.
The algorithm learns to identify labels from data and predicts them for unseen sentences.
Named entity recognition involves annotating words in a sentence as named entities. More formally, given an input sequence S=[w1,w2,...,wN], we predict corresponding labels Y=[y1,y2,...,yN].
NER becomes very useful when we are handling unstructured data and we want to know about the sentiments of the data or different entity. Also when we are handling biomedical data NER plays a very important role.
NER also works as subproblems of various NLP problem.

In this project I have taken a dataset from kaggle trained it with BILSTM and done Named Entity Recognition
